    go golfing? Incase they have hole in one!" When everyone is
    serious and not happy, you can change their mood.

  <h2>You must tell some dad jokes to someone you talk with</h2>

    looks at you, you should just shout out some jokes.  
    Tell some dad jokes to everyone  even if you don't know them.

     your friends just pass the ball to each other, is it fun? No! you

     as tennis, you must tell some dad jokes to them.
